This workload achieves an average of 18.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 17.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions.
